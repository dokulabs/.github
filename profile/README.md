## Key Features

- **Dokumetry SDKs**: Lightweight and easy-to-integrate SDKs (`dokumetry`) aimed at simplifying the collection of LLM usage data.
- **Zero Latency**: The `dokumetry` SDKs are built with latency at mind and can process your LLM call usage data
- **Doku UI**: Doku UI to show comprehensible visual dashboards tailored for LLMs.
- **Data Exportability**: Flexibility to export LLM Observability data to your preferred observability tools, like Grafana, DataDog and more.

### Broad LLM Support:

- **OpenAI**
- **Cohere**
- **Anthropic**
- **Mistral**
- **Azure OpenAI**

We plan to extend our support to more LLMs and Vector Databases.

### Community-First Approach:

Doku is built on open-source collaborations. Simple, direct, and open for all, we encourage your input to help shape Doku's evolution.
